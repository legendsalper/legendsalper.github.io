    <h2>Who am I ?</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Welcome to my internet site. I am Alper. I am from Hatay/TÃ¼rkiye.
        My family is from Hatay too since many generations. That might be the
        reason for me eating too much :). Because Hatay is very famous by it's
        food. I live in a cute house near the river called "Asi".
        I decided to be a game developer when I was just a little child.
        Me and my father played too many video games together. When I was 12,
        I did game reviews to foreign game critics internet site's. They thought I was
        20 :D. But thanks to my father I played all the game franchies since 80's.
        After making reviews to foreign sites. Some Turkish sites found me. And offered
        me job. I worked to them when I was 16 and 18 but I quit becouse Turkish people
        does not have the required culture for video games critics. They just like
        people who shouts to screen telling stupid things about games that they don't have
        any single idea about it. So now I am studing Computer Engineering in order to
        become a person who knows how to code well. So in the future I can <mark>develop
            my own games.</mark>
