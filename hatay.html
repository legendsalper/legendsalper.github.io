<h1>My home city Hatay!</h1>
<hr>
<p>Hatay Province (Turkish: Hatay ili, pronounced [ˈhataj]) is a province in southern Turkey, on the eastern Mediterranean
    coast. The administrative capital is Antakya (Antioch), and the other major city in the province is the port city of
    İskenderun (Alexandretta). It is bordered by Syria to the south and east and the Turkish provinces of Adana and Osmaniye
    to the north. The province is part of Çukurova (Cilicia), a geographical, economical and cultural region that covers the
    provinces of Mersin, Adana, Osmaniye, and Hatay. There are border crossing points with Syria in the district of Yayladağı
    and at Cilvegözü in the district of Reyhanlı. Sovereignty over the province remains disputed with neighbouring Syria, which
    claims that the province was separated from itself against the stipulations of the French Mandate of Syria in the years
    following Syria's independence from the Ottoman Empire after World War I. Although the two countries have remained generally
    peaceful in their dispute over the territory, Syria has never formally renounced its claims to it.</p>

<p>I really like Hatay. Because of the multiculture it has. In our apartment lives families from all kind of beleives. Which makes me happy,
    because I get to know all different kinds of cultures and believes. And also one more thing which I really like about Hatay is it's geography.
    I've seen many cities. But none of them has the geographic beauty of Hatay. In Hatay there is see, there is a river called Asi (which is the
    only river that flows in the wrong direction) and there are beatiful mountains and caves near the see side. When ever I feel bad I go to the naturally
    beatiful places of Hatay so that I can feel better.
